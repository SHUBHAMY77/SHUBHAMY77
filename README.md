### üíª About Me
I'm a senior data engineer with 3+ years of experience specializing in building and optimizing robust data pipelines and scalable data architectures. My passion lies in transforming raw data into actionable insights and high-quality data products for analytical and operational use cases. I have a proven track record of designing, developing, and maintaining end-to-end ETL/ELT processes in both on-premise and cloud environments.

*   üî≠ I currently work on designing & Devloping Data Warehouse Snowflake,Bigquery.
*   üå± I'm currently expanding my knowledge in serverless data processing with AWS Lambda, advanced data modeling techniques.
*   üëØ I am looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to [e.g., data governance, data orchestration tools].
*   üí¨ Ask me about: data warehousing, cloud data architecture, pipeline optimization, and data quality best practices.
*   ‚ö° Fun fact: When I'm not wrangling data, you can find me gaming, cooking a new dish
